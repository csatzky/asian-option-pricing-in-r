# Asian and European Option Specificsâ€“Pricing, Estimation, and Comparison Using R

In this article, I present methods to efficiently estimate the price and the probability of exercise for vanilla and exotic options. In addition, I am using these results to compare the empirical delta between European and average rate Asian options. The research is 100% reproducible.
